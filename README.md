## Behaviour reminders from HUD Core

- The Image of the items can be displayed by selecting 'Display Icons' in the HUD Core settings.
- Right clicking will open the item's window by selecting 'Open Item Sheet on Right-Click' in the HUD Core settings (right-clicking on a pool name will do nothing).
- Some users might prefer to enable the 'Click to Open Categories' in the HUD Core Settings, so that hovering over HUD category names doesn't automatically open the sub-menu.

## Installation
